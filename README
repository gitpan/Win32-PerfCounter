Win32/PerfCounter
=================

The Win32 API features a high performance counter that allows 
measuring extremely short time spans. Depending on your machine, 
the resolution should be around 1 microsecond (1 second = 1_000_000
microseconds). This module is an interface to the Win32 API 
functions QueryPerformanceCounter and QueryperformanceFrequency that
implement this counter.
